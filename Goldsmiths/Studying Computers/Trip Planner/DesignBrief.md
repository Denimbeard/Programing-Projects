## Details

This page outlines key elements of each of the design briefs for the Design Assignment. As specified on the Design Assignment page, you will need to pick one of those for your project.

## Split the bill at the restaurant

Users of this app are looking for a simple way to split the bill at the restaurant at the end of the meal. They are interested in quick ways to identify who ordered what and create totals per person without having to analyse the bill in details and use a calculator.

The app should also offer options for sub-groups (eg 2 couples) and ways to instantly repay someone if the restaurant doesn't accept separate payments.

## Manage my smart thermostat at home

Users of this app own a smart thermostat and want a simple way to manage the temperature at home. They should be able to define the optimal temperature throughout the day while optimising their energy consumption.

The service should also allow them to cut the heating off for when they are on holiday and should provide a way to reactivate it from a distance before coming back home.

## Trip planner, multi-destination itinerary

Users of this app are looking to book large multi-destination itineraries covering several months of travel. This can be people looking to take a gap year or a holiday over multiple weeks or months.

The app should allow them to do their initial research, plan their trip, book flights and potentially interact with travel specialists or community members to get knowledgeable insights about the destination.

## Kids medication reminder app

A paediatric department at a hospital has identified that children can develop erratic habits in taking their medication from around the age of 11. A mobile app could be a good way to encourage and ensure patients are getting their medication on time.

It is anticipated that the app will be used at school so the design needs to be relatively discrete. Children shouldn't feel out of place with their mates at school. The app should give a visual tracking representation and reward good behaviour.

The time that patients need to take their pills isn't always as simple as at a certain time of day. It can be within a certain window of eating (during, or half an hour before or after for example.) So the patients weekly timetable needs to be considered in some way to remind them to take their prescription.

The app should have a parent's mode. The kids shouldn't always be responsible for adding in the various medications, the times they need to be taken and the dosage, and their school timetable. Also, the app should alert parents that the supplies of a particular medication are low so that a new prescription can be ordered.

## Outfit generator

Users are interested in a fast way to create a fashionable outfit from the items available in their wardrobe. They want to save time in the morning without having to think about what they should wear.

The app should allow them to input the items they own in their wardrobe. It should be smart enough to consider the different seasons, occasions and maybe the weather on the day.
