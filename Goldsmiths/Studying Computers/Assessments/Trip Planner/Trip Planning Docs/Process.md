## Hypothesis  

TO DO:

## Method

What method are we going to use and why?

### Online survey

|Pros|Cons|

|Anonymous (good for bias)|Less variety of response formats (i.e the responses wouldn't be as nuanced as in person|
|Easy to execute|Due to anonymity, there is no information known about the individual outside of the survey data.|
|Consistent dataset||
|Able to reach more people||
|Easy data management for review||

### 1 to 1 interview

|Pros|Cons|
|--|--|
|More flexible data set|Selection bias|
|Can get higher value answers|Inconsistent data|
|Can ask bonus / situational  questions|Harder to analyse|
||Time consuming|
||Hard to set up|
||Harder to manage data|

TO DO:

- Add more possibilities
- Write a paragraph on why we chose online survey over a 1 to 1 interview

## Process

### Show the results

TO DO:

- Finalize questions
- Organize data

### Analysis

Critically analyse the data given and compare to the initial hypothesis.

TO DO:

- Analyse competitors (at least 2)
- analyze our previous user journey with pain points and opportunities, and form a new one a list of requirements (features 2 per person) that our app needs to have (after analysis)
