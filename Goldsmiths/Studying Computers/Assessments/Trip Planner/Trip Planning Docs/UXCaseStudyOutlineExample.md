## What is a user research case study?

A user research case study is your way to demonstrate the value you provide to an organization. It is a story about a project you have accomplished and gives your audience a step-by-step understanding of how you approached it.

Case studies are at the heart of an interview and an integral piece to making it through to the next step during the interview process. If you tell a compelling and clear story of projects, you are more likely to get more interviews and further the interview process. Additionally, you will feel more confident during the interview process, and with any next steps.

I promise you it is worth the time and effort to invest in your case studies.

## What should be in a user research case study?

When you write a user research case study, there are areas you should include. However, always use your judgment. If a particular project did not cover one of these topics, you donâ€™t have to make something up or force information into it. Use these topics as guidelines.

As a hiring manager, I always look for the following in user research case studies:

- Context
- Your role
- Timeline
- Research statement and goals
- Research methodology
- Recruitment criteria and process
- Sample questions asked or usability tasks
- Analysis and synthesis process
- Outputs/deliverables
- Impact
- Next steps and recommendations
- Reflections

Optional:

- Your/team biases and assumptions

### The outline

Before you even think about designing your portfolio, write it all down here!

Put as much information into each section as you can. It is much easier to cut down on information when putting it into a presentation format than creating more information. As a bonus, this outline can act like speaker notes while you practice or during the actual presentation (if you are doing it remotely)!

Make sure that you explain the details of each section. For each relevant section, ensure you can answer who, what, when, why, and how.

### Context and background

Give a small introduction to yourself of something outside of your resume (ex: what has changed about you in the past five years, your favorite hobbies). Also, give a short introduction and context to the organization. Finally, briefly introduce the project topic. Keep in mind to not use any jargon from the industry that others may not understand.

### Your role

What was your role in the research project? Who else did you work with, and how did you work with them? Were you a leader of the project? How did you prioritize this project?

### Timeline

What was the overall timeline of the project? Consider breaking down the different parts of the timeline (ex: recruitment X weeks, research Y weeks, analysis Z weeks)

### Research statement and goals

#### What is the research problem/question that you were trying to answer? Where did this problem/question come from (ex: previous research, management)? Did you need to get buy-in for this research? If so, how?

Research statements are what you are trying to learn or understand better about your users. An example you can use to model research statements is:

`We want to better understand how *users think about/ make decisions on/interact with* **subject of research/ product** in order to *create/improve product/website/ app/service*.

### What were the goals of the research project?

Research goals are the different areas you seek to learn more about during our study. These directly relate to the research statement. There are five common research goals present in most user research studies:

- Discover people's current processes/decision-making about [research subject], and how they feel about the overall experience
- Learn about people's current pain points, frustrations, and barriers about [existing process/current tools] and how they would improve it
- Uncover the current tools people are using to [achieve goal], and their experience with those tools. Uncover how they would improve those tools
- Understand what [research subject] means to people (how they define it) and why it is important to them
- Evaluate how people are using a [product/website/app/ service ] OR
  - Evaluate how people are currently interacting with a [product/ website/app/service]

### Research methodology

- What methodologies did you use for the project?
- Why did you choose these methods?
- How did you conclude on these methods?
- Think about combining qualitative and quantitative research methods and how they worked together.
  - Were other stakeholders a part of the research?
  - How long did the interviews last?
  - How many were there?

### Recruitment criteria and process

- Who did you recruit for the study?
- Why did you recruit these particular people?
- How did you recruit them (ex: tools)?
- Did you incentivize them?
  - Why or why not?
- What are some examples of screener questions?

### Sample questions or usability tasks

Show some examples of your questions from a moderation guide, or tasks you asked during the usability test. If possible, you can link to the actual moderatorâ€™s guide.

### Analysis and synthesis process

- How did you analyze and synthesize all of the data?
- What types of techniques and processes did you use?
- Did you debrief after each of the sessions?
  - Why/why not?
- Who else was a part of the synthesis process?
  - Include examples and screenshots, even if that means you have to blur out sensitive information!

### Outputs and deliverables

- What were the outputs of the research?
- What were the deliverables, and why did you choose those?
- How did you share the research (ex: reports with videos).
  - Include examples and screenshots, even if that means you have to blur out sensitive information!

### Impact

- What was the impact of your research on the team, the organization, and the business?
- Who used the insights, and how did they use them?
- What changed because of your research?
- What were the business implications of your research (ex: impacting business metrics/KPIs)?

### Next steps and recommendations

- What are the next steps after the research?
- What is the follow-up?
- What recommendations did you make to the team and organization?
- How did the research insights tie to any design or product changes?

### Reflections

Reflect on the research project.

- What went well?
- What didnâ€™t go as well?
- What challenges did you face?
- What would you change/improve for next time?

### Your/teams assumptions and biases

- What were any biases or assumptions your team had?
- What were some hypotheses?
- Were these validated or disproved from the research?
- What did that lead to?
