## Design Assignment

This document describes the requirements for the [Design Project](https://learn.gold.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=923134) and outlines the different stages you should go through. The tools and methods will be covered during the upcoming lectures and labs, so don't worry if not everything makes sense just yet. Each stage of the project will be explained individually as we go along.

This assignment will be undertaken in **teams** of 3 or 4 students. You should be working in the same group as the website assignment. **The final deliverable will be a report**. It should be about ***2000*** words in length, however, this is just a guide and not a fixed word limit.

## Deadline is on the 26th of April at 5 pm. One submission only per group

## The brief

The aim of this project is to research, design and test a mobile app answering one of the following briefs. To do so, you will need to use the different UX techniques covered in class from problem definition to user testing.

You will pick one design brief from the following list. More details on each design brief can be found here.

- ~~Split the bill at the restaurant~~
- ~~Manage my smart thermostat at home~~
- Trip planner, multi-destination itinerary
- ~~Kids medication reminder app~~
- ~~Outfit generator~~

## How to approach this task

The following outlines the recommended stages of the project. You are free to make those your own but they all come with a set of requires deliverables that you will be marked on.

**This is a big project, it is highly recommended to follow the timescale indicated in brackets for each of the stages.**

## Step 1: Initial research and requirements (2 weeks)

In this step, you will gather evidence to define what problem you are trying to solve with your app and define a list of requirements.

### Step 1: Suggested activities

- User interview (to be done remotely!)
  - *As you won't have access to a wide range of users, you can start experimenting with user interview techniques on friends and family or on other students from the class.*
  - It would be recommended to conduct at least one user interview per member in your group.
- Competitors analysis
  - Identify at least 2 other services that are similar to your brief
- Personas/Mindsets creation
- User journey with pain points and opportunities
- Problem statement and opportunity description
- List of requirements

### Step 1: Minimum deliverables

- Key user needs (either in the form of persona or user journey)
- Problem statement and evidence to support it
- Market research
- List of requirements
  - **To adjust the scale of the project to the size of your group, you should have at least 2 key features per person in your group**

## Step 2: Ideation and sketching (1 week)

In this step, you will generate and sketch ideas for your app to answer the requirements listed in the previous phase. Your ideas should present an innovative element and shouldn't be a replica of one of the competitors app.

### Step 2: Suggested activities

- Generate ideas for each of the features in your list
- Evaluate and select the best ideas
- Sketch key screens and add annotations to show how things work

### Step 2: Minimum deliverables

- Evidence of ideas generated (eg screenshot of a whiteboard)
- A range of interface sketches with annotations

## Step 3: Prototype (2 weeks)

In this step, you will create an interactive prototype that will be tested in the next stage.

### Step 3: Suggested activities

- Identify a flow you want to test and draw it out
- Create more detailed wire frames for each screen in the flow
- Build an interactive prototype, ready for testing

### Step 3: Minimum deliverables

- Flow chart
- Refined prototype of the sketches you have developed in stage 2 (link to the interactive prototype online or sketches attached in the appendix)

## Step 4: Remote user testing (1 week)

In this step, you will test your prototype with potential users to identify opportunities for improvement.

### Step 4: Suggested activities

- Define the objectives of your test (what you are trying to validate)
- Write a test script
- Test with a few users **remotely**. *As you won't have access to a wide range of users, you can start experimenting with user interview techniques on friends and family or on other students from the class.*
  - It would be recommended to conduct at least one user interview per member in your group.
- Analyse your findings and discuss how you would make changes to your designs in a second iteration

### Step 4: Minimum deliverables

- Test script
- List of insights

## Step 5: Report writing (2 weeks)

If you have followed the recommended structure to run your project, creating your report will just require compiling each part into a document. Additionally, you will need to write a **self-evaluation** of your work as a group.

**Note**: *Previously I indicated that your report should be around 2000 words. There will be no formal word limit. so you won't be penalized for being over or under but 2000 words should be a useful guide.*

## What to submit

You need to submit 2 files in total:

- 1. Your report as ONE .pdf file
  - It should include all the necessary links and images listed above.
  - Please make sure it is assembled into ONE single pdf file.
- 2. Group contribution document

You'll also need to submit a file showing the breakdown of the tasks in your group (who did what!). Please download and use [this](Goldsmiths/Studying Computers/Trip Planner/ContributionDoc.md) template. You will need to fill out the file together and digitally sign it before submitting it.
