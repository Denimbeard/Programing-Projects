# Introduction

Welcome to Foundations of Programming's main page. From here you will be able to download lecture notes, lecture recordings, lab sheets and assignments as they are progressively added. A short list of recommended textbooks, including the one that we will be following throughout the course, is also provided.

If you have any general questions, before you email me please DO post them to the Student Discussion forum - your query (and the answer) is likely relevant to everyone else on this course.

For other (e.g., personal) questions not of general interest, do feel free to email me at <M.Garagnani@gold.ac.uk>, however please first check out these tips about emailing your Lecturers, as well as some (good and bad) examples of emails.

- (This year I will be awarding prizes to those who do not start their email with: "Hey Sir,"... smile)

I look forward to seeing you all soon in the classroom!

With very best wishes,
Max
